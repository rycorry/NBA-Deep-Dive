NBA Deep Dive Streamlit App

This is my code for the NBA deep dive data set and the streamlit app that I made! You can take a look at each team in the NBA specifically and their points versus their non-free throw points. You can also download the data set directly from the app, you can search up a specific players stats, you can see a chart of the top scorers in the NBA and change the number of players you want to see!
